                <p class="beach-intro">
                    Yonaha Maehama Beach, located on Miyakojima Island in Okinawa, is often described as one of
                    the most beautiful beaches in Japan. With its seven kilometers of pure white sand and
                    breathtaking turquoise waters, it offers a tropical experience that feels almost unreal.
                    The beach is famous for its soft shoreline, shallow clear waters, and unforgettable sunsets,
                    making it a favorite destination among travelers, photographers, and ocean lovers.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">One of Japan’s Most Beautiful Beaches</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Yonaha Maehama is consistently ranked among Japan’s top beaches for good reason. The sand is
                    incredibly fine, soft, and white—so smooth that it almost feels like powder beneath your feet.
                    Combined with the striking contrast of turquoise waters, the scenery is nothing short of
                    spectacular. Many visitors are surprised by how clear and vibrant the ocean looks, especially
                    under strong sunlight when the waves sparkle like crystal.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Beyond its beauty, the beach stretches for a full seven kilometers, making it perfect for long
                    walks, peaceful exploration, or simply enjoying your own quiet spot away from the crowd. Even
                    on busy days, Yonaha Maehama never feels overcrowded thanks to its wide and spacious layout.
                    Whether you’re sunbathing, swimming, or just relaxing under the blue sky, the area offers
                    enough room for everyone to enjoy the natural surroundings.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">Crystal-Clear Water Perfect for Swimming</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    The water at Yonaha Maehama is famously clear, gentle, and shallow, making it ideal for
                    swimmers of all ages. Families with children love this beach because the waves are usually
                    mild, and the ocean floor remains shallow for a long distance. This provides a safe and
                    comfortable environment for kids to play and swim.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    The clarity of the water also makes it a great spot for snorkelers and casual swimmers who
                    want to see the underwater world. While Yonaha Maehama is not a major snorkeling spot
                    compared to nearby areas like Yoshino Beach, it still offers beautiful views of coral sand,
                    small fish, and gentle currents that make the experience enjoyable and relaxing.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">A Tropical Atmosphere That Feels Like a Dream</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Unlike mainland beaches, Yonaha Maehama offers a true tropical vibe. The warm air, lush
                    greenery, and wide-open sky create a vacation atmosphere that instantly makes visitors feel
                    at ease. The beach is especially famous for its calm, peaceful environment—many travelers
                    describe it as a place where they can disconnect from daily stress and experience pure
                    relaxation.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    During early mornings, the beach is incredibly quiet, with only gentle waves and the sound
                    of sea birds. This makes it a perfect spot for meditation, yoga, or peaceful photography.
                    As the day progresses, the sunlight enhances the turquoise color of the water, giving the
                    beach an almost glowing appearance. Sunset is another magical moment—when the sun dips below
                    the horizon, the sky turns into a warm blend of orange and pink, creating a scene that feels
                    like a tropical postcard.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">Activities to Enjoy at Yonaha Maehama</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    Beyond swimming and sunbathing, Yonaha Maehama offers a variety of fun activities for visitors.
                    Water sports such as banana boat rides, jet skiing, SUP (stand-up paddleboarding), and
                    kayaking are widely available during the summer season. The calm waters make these activities
                    enjoyable even for beginners.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    If you prefer a slower pace, you can rent a beach chair and umbrella, enjoy a refreshing drink
                    from nearby shops, or go for a long walk along the shoreline. Cyclists also enjoy exploring the
                    coastal area, especially since Miyakojima is known for its smooth roads and beautiful seaside
                    views. The nearby Kurima Island can be accessed via the stunning Kurima Bridge, offering more
                    photo spots and relaxing viewpoints.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">Nearby Attractions & Facilities</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    The beach is conveniently located near several hotels, resorts, and local restaurants. This makes
                    it easy for travelers to spend the whole day by the water without worrying about food or rest
                    areas. Public facilities such as showers, restrooms, and parking lots are also available,
                    ensuring a comfortable experience for all visitors.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    If you’re interested in exploring more of Miyakojima, nearby spots such as Sunayama Beach,
                    Yoshino Coast, and Aragusuku Beach are must-visits. Each location offers a different style of
                    scenery—from natural rock arches to coral reefs and snorkeling spots. Together, they create a
                    perfect beach-hopping experience for travelers who want to enjoy the island to its fullest.
                </p>

                <h3 class="beach-heading">Best Time to Visit Yonaha Maehama Beach</h3>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    The best time to visit is between April and October, when temperatures are warm and the skies
                    are clear. Summer offers the most vibrant atmosphere, but spring and autumn provide equally
                    stunning views with fewer crowds. Winter is cooler, but still mild compared to mainland Japan,
                    and the beach remains beautiful year-round.
                </p>
                <p class="beach-text">
                    For the clearest water and the deepest turquoise shades, visiting between June and August is
                    ideal. However, travelers should be aware of the typhoon season, which can bring strong winds
                    and waves. Checking the weather forecast before your trip will help ensure the best experience.
                </p>

                    incredible sunsets make it a dream destination for beach lovers. Whether you want a relaxing
